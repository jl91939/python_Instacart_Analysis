# Project Brief: Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis.
## Introduction
In this project, I assume the role of a analyst for Instacart. Instacart already has good sales but want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. Here I perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation.

## Key Questions and Objectives.
Instacart stakeholders are most interested in a variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They can't target everyone using the same methods and are considering a targeted marketing strategy. Instacart would like to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see what effect it would have on the sale of products. The analysis will inform what the startegy may look like to ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with appropriate products. The key questions and objects answered would be: 

```
● The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.
● The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:
   ○ What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?
   ○ Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
   ○ Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
   ○ Is there aconnection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
   ○ What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
   ○ What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.

# Project Deliverables and Final Analysis Critera.

```
● Project folder follows industry standards in terms of structure and naming conventions.
● Analysis has been conducted using Jupyter notebooks and the Anaconda libraries manager.
● Analysis has been conducted using Python and relevant libraries (pandas, NumPy, os, matplotlib, scipy, and seaborn).
● All required libraries have been successfully installed and imported into each script.
● Python scripts are clean and easy to follow with headings and contents lists.
● All code is consistent (e.g., with the use of quotation marks and spaces) and includes descriptive comments.
● Allrequired data sets have been successfully installed and imported into each script.
● Descriptive checks have been conducted after importation of data, such as checking the top and the bottom of the dataframe.
● Whenever a dataframe is altered, checks have been conducted to determine its shape and basic statistics.
● All project data has been merged into a single data set. A frequency of the merge flag shows the merged data set is a 100% match to the combined original data sets.
● Merged data set only contains variables to be used in the analysis.
● All column names are self-explanatory.
● All identifier variables follow the industry standard data type.
● Data has been cleaned. Duplicate data, missing data, and mixed-type columns have been checked and addressed.
● Samples have been exported whenever an exclusions flag has been created.
● All subsamples have been exported and saved in the proper folder following a consistent naming convention.
● Any new columns that have been derived are relevant to the needs of the analysis.
● At least 4 types of data visualizations have been generated to communicate insights to stakeholders. Visualizations are clearly labeled.
● Data ethics have been kept in mind when dealing with data, especially in regards to customer information.
● Final report includes evidence of analysis methodology, clear answers to the questions in this brief, and recommendations for Instacart stakeholders.
● Final report contains data citation for Instacart and customer data sets.
